description: >-
  Triage Kubernetes problems in real time, driven by standard in-cluster alerting.
  A Prometheus Alertmanager (or kubernetes-event-exporter) running in the user's
  cluster POSTs firing alerts to this agent's webhook; the agent investigates the
  root cause (read-only kubectl via Claude Code) and reports severity + fix + an
  "Open in Lens" deep link. Deduplication is handled upstream by Alertmanager.
  Follow this skill when a k8s-alerts webhook run fires, or when setting up / when
  the user asks to monitor, watch, or triage Kubernetes problems, pod failures,
  crashloops, image-pull errors, scheduling failures, or cluster warnings.

# Kubernetes triage (in-cluster alerting → webhook)

Real-time Kubernetes triage with **no in-sandbox watcher**. A standard, Kubernetes-supervised
component in the user's cluster detects problems and POSTs them to this agent's **webhook**; the
agent triages and reports. Kubernetes supervises the sender, and **deduplication is off-the-shelf**
(Alertmanager grouping/`repeat_interval`/inhibition/silences), so there is no fragile daemon and no
alert spam.

```

- **Primary trigger: Alertmanager** (via `kube-prometheus-stack` + `kube-state-metrics`, which ship
  the rules — `KubePodCrashLooping`, `KubePodNotReady`, image-pull, OOM, HPA, node pressure, …). Its
  `group_by` / `repeat_interval` / inhibition / silences **are the deduplication**.
- **Optional: `kubernetes-event-exporter`** for raw Warning *events* not backed by metrics
  (FailedMount/FailedScheduling, Flux/ArgoCD controller events).
- **Webhook configuration is yours, not the skill's.** The skill makes no assumptions about how the
  webhook endpoint is exposed, addressed, or authenticated — that depends on your Prism deployment.
  You create the webhook once in Prism's **Web UI** and wire your Alertmanager to it (see Part B).

Example Alertmanager / event-exporter config is in **`references/in-cluster-setup.md`**; the triage
method is in **`references/triage-runbook.md`**.

---

## Part A — When a `k8s-alerts` webhook run fires, do this

Your run was triggered by the `k8s-alerts` webhook. **The incident payload is in your prompt** — the
Alertmanager JSON (or event-exporter event) rendered by the subscription's template (typically the
raw payload: `{"alerts":[{"labels":{"alertname","namespace","pod"/workload,…},"annotations":{"summary","description"}}, …]}`).

1. **Parse the firing alert(s)** from the payload: for each, extract the workload identity
   (`namespace`, and the `pod`/`deployment`/`statefulset`/… label) and the reason/summary. Alertmanager
   has already deduped/grouped — triage what's in this payload; don't re-poll for "all warnings".
2. **Delegate the investigation to `claude_code`** (`mode: "plan"`, read-only) following
   `references/triage-runbook.md`:

```
claude_code({
  mode: "plan",
  prompt: "Triage a Kubernetes incident. Firing alerts: <PASTE the parsed alerts: namespace/kind/name/reason/summary + startsAt>.
    Follow the k8s-event-triage skill's references/triage-runbook.md with READ-ONLY kubectl: scope the
    blast radius; gather evidence (describe / logs --previous / get events / top / node conditions); and
    CHECK WHAT CHANGED recently (rollout history, current image, recent events, pod age) and correlate
    it to the alert onset (startsAt) — if a GitHub tool is available, find the correlating commit/PR.
    Do NOT run any mutating command (delete / scale / rollout restart|undo / edit / apply / drain /
    patch); note that 'kubectl rollout history' is read-only and allowed.
    Return a concise report per the runbook's Output format, INCLUDING an 'Investigation' trail (the
    commands you ran → the decisive finding from each), a 'Recent change' line (what changed + when
    vs onset, or 'no recent change'), and a 'Class:' line with ONE root-cause class keyword from
    oom|crashloop|image-pull|scheduling|node-pressure|config|quota|network|app-error|unknown,
    then root cause (citing the trail) + the suggested fix as a
    command to PROPOSE (not run). IF a cluster specifier is available, add an 'Open in Lens' link
    per cited resource as a Markdown link (never raw lens:// / never in code), built EXACTLY as:
    https://app.k8slens.dev/lens-launcher?c=<encodeURIComponent of the inner lens:// URL>
    where the inner URL is
    lens://app/open/<connectionType>/<clusterSpecifier>/cluster<versionless apiBase, e.g. /apis/apps/deployments or /api/pods>?kube-details=<urlencoded FULL versioned selfLink, e.g. /apis/apps/v1/namespaces/<ns>/deployments/<name>>
    The inner URL MUST begin with lens://app/open/ — any other shape (e.g.
    lens://cluster/<hash>/workloads/...) fails in Lens Desktop with 'invalid host'. Details +
    worked example: the runbook's 'Deep links' section. If no specifier: omit links entirely."
})
```

   Then poll `claude_code_status({ taskId })` until `completed`. Keep the read-only rule in the
   prompt — plan mode blocks file edits, not mutating `kubectl`.

   ⚠️ **ONLY YOUR FINAL RESPONSE IS DELIVERED.** In a webhook run, the user (Slack/chat) receives
   exactly one message: the text you produce **after your last tool call**. Nothing you write
   between tool calls is posted anywhere — "the report is above" is NEVER true for the user, and
   the `claude_code_status` `result` is a tool output only you can see. Two real failures to
   never repeat: a run whose only delivered message was *"Report delivered and logged. Standing
   by."* and one that said *"Done. Triage delivered above."* — in both, the user received NO
   report at all.

3. **Record the work (optional, one call) — BEFORE writing the report.** If
   `/data/skills/work-telemetry/` exists, follow that skill's "How to record work" section
   ([prism-work-telemetry](https://github.com/msa0311/prism-work-telemetry)) with:
   - `type: "k8s.triage"`, `trigger: "webhook"`
   - `id`: `"<alertname>/<namespace>/<workload>"` — stable fingerprint, same problem ⇒ same id
   - `severity`: the rubric result, lowercased (`critical|high|medium|low|info`)
   - `category`: the report's `Class:` root-cause keyword
   - `outcome`: `diagnosed` (root cause found, fix proposed) · `needs_human` (low confidence or
     approval needed) · `recovered` (already self-healed) · `false_positive` (Low + cosmetic/
     already resolved) · `escalated` (Critical, humans paged)
   - `detected_at`: the alert's `startsAt`; `attrs`: `{"k8s.namespace": …, "alert.name": …}`
   - omit `human_minutes_saved` to use the configured per-type default

   If the work-telemetry skill is not installed, skip this step silently — never let recording
   block, delay, or fail the triage itself. Do any memory writes here too — **all tool calls
   happen in this step, before the report.**

4. **Deliver: write the full triage report as your final response — and stop.**
   - Compose it from `claude_code`'s `result`, after **validating every Lens link**: each must
     start with `https://app.k8slens.dev/lens-launcher?c=lens%3A%2F%2Fapp%2Fopen%2F` — anything
     else, rebuild it per the runbook's Deep-links template or drop it (a wrong link is worse
     than none).
   - The report is the WHOLE message: no "Done", no "recorded", no "standing by", no summary of
     what you did — lead with the triage content and end with it.
   - **No tool calls after the report.** If you realize more tool work is needed after you
     already wrote report text, do the tool calls and then **repeat the full report** as your
     new final response — earlier text was not delivered.

The method, severity rubric, per-symptom playbook, safety rails, and the `lens://` launcher-link
format all live in `references/triage-runbook.md` — that's what Claude Code follows.

---

## Part B — Setup (one-time, done by you)

After installing the skill, one thing must be wired up before anything happens: **a webhook that
your in-cluster alerting POSTs to**. The skill does not create or configure this — it's your
webhook, in your Alertmanager, secured however your Prism deployment requires. Prism's **Web UI has
a Webhooks page** for exactly this.

1. **Install the skill:** `npx skills add github:msa0311/prism-k8s-event-triage -g -a claude-code --copy`,
   or drop this bundle into `<DATA>/skills/`.
2. **Create the webhook in the Prism Web UI** (**Webhooks** page): enable webhooks, then create a
   subscription named `k8s-alerts` with a **prompt template** that embeds the raw payload and points
   at this skill — e.g.
   *"A Kubernetes alert fired: {__raw__}. Follow the k8s-event-triage skill (Part A) to triage it."*
   Copy the endpoint URL shown next to the subscription.
3. **Point your Alertmanager (or `kubernetes-event-exporter`) at that URL.** How the endpoint is
   reachable from the cluster and whether it needs auth headers depends on your Prism deployment —
   that part is up to you. `references/in-cluster-setup.md` has example Alertmanager /
   event-exporter config to start from.
4. **(Optional) Make the triage work measurable:** install
   [prism-work-telemetry](https://github.com/msa0311/prism-work-telemetry) and configure its
   collector endpoint — every triage then lands on the central agent-work dashboard
   (e.g. [prism-work-dashboard](https://github.com/msa0311/prism-work-dashboard)).

## Notes & limits
- **No in-sandbox component** — nothing to keep alive; a runtime/sandbox restart doesn't break triage.
- **Dedup is upstream** (Alertmanager). `kubernetes-event-exporter` only has k8s event `count`
  aggregation, so prefer Alertmanager for anything you want deduped.
- Requires the user to run Prometheus/Alertmanager for the primary path (event-exporter is the
  lighter alternative), and to set up the webhook + in-cluster config themselves (Part B).
- **Work recording (Part A step 3) is best-effort** — it must never block, delay, or replace
  the triage report; without the work-telemetry skill it's skipped entirely.
